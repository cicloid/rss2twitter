Run "ruby rss2twitter.rb" and follow the directions.

TODO:

- Make the set-up interactive so you don't have to create a YAML file; perhaps store settings in the database

- Support multiple feeds; perhaps let the script support commands like "rss2twitter add <feed>" and "rss2twitter remove <feed>" and "rss2twitter list" etc.

- Integrate with TinyURL so less description verbiage is truncated
