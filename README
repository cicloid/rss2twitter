	Original logic borrowed from http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/3714

	Heavily modified (and improved I hope) by Ted (rss2twitter@rudiment.net)

HOWTO:
	
	Run "ruby rss2twitter.rb" and follow the directions.

TODO:

	- Switch to http://is.gd to save even MORE precious characters!

	- Make the set-up interactive so you don't have to create a YAML file; perhaps store settings in the database

	- Support multiple feeds; perhaps let the script support commands like "rss2twitter add <feed>" and "rss2twitter remove <feed>" and "rss2twitter list" etc.
